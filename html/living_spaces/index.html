    <h1>Living (and increasingly working) spaces</h1>
    <p>
      On this page you will find photos of various places I've lived over the years. 
      Mainly focussed around the desk / working spaces. <br>
      These photos were not necessarily taken with the intention of being shared. In fact I'm not sure why they were taken, but
      its quite nice to look back on places I used to inhabit & see how my setups have changed over time.

    <h2>La Goutte d'Or (Current living space)</h2>

    <p>This is my "alpine" hideaway within my apartment. This is generally where I spend most of my time and my current work area</p>
    <p>The desk area is fairly spartan & with zero frills. No wall decorations at present.</p>
    <p>There's also a fairly small music setup behind me. Cables dangling everywhere which never get used. And speakers I haven't bothered to plug in</p>
    <br>

    <p>A view of both the desk & music areas simultaneously. This little hideaway was clearly designed with short people in mind!</p>
    <h2>Rue Marcadet (2020-2023)</h2>
    <img src="assets/img/marcadet_setup.jpeg" alt="Marcadet setup" width="800px">
    <p>Allowed the music area to spread almost all around me in this apartment.</p>

    <p>A couple more views of the apartment. Including a rare shot of me at my desk</p>
    <h2>Crecy-la-Chapelle (2019-2020)</h2>
    <img src="assets/img/crecy.jpeg" alt="crecy" width="600px">
    <p>Found suprisingly little evidence of my existence here. Captured this image from a video I found in my Google drive.<br>
      From what I remember this was a very small and cluttered desk. Back in the (semi-)long hair days too.

    <h2>Amsterdam Oost(2015-2019)</h2>

    <p>First image shows an early music setup. The beatstep pro has long gone, as has that little piano in the background
    <br>Second image is the other side of the (quite long) room</p>

    The music in this folder is usually a result of focusing on a particular process
    I've come across from a musician or composer. Usually just trying to emulate it
    in a different context to which it was originally described.
  </p>
  <p >
    It's experimental in the sense also that I've explored an idea to the point that I'm
    done with it and then export it, rather than worrying about or altering it with futher effects.

  <p style="font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left;"> This is from sometime in 2019 I believe... though its a bit vague.
    I made it after reading about an approach Brian Eno took to composing a song by creating
    loops of different lengths (between say 20 seconds and 70 seconds, doesn't really matter though) with one or a couple of notes played at random at some point in that time.
    I think I recorded about 10 loops or something like that

    I can't remember where exactly I read about this process: it might've been this <a href="https://teropa.info/blog/2016/07/28/javascript-systems-music.html#the-notes-and-intervals-in-music-for-airports">js process music programming article</a>
    but i have a feeling it wasn't quite that. That article is amazing anyway for programming generative audio in styles of Steve Reich and Eno.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left;">
    So if you start with one or two loops playing and gradually bring in other loops they'll start to overlap eachother at varying times and so create
    something which is non-repeating. I applied this to Ableton and recorded it with some other bits of electronic stuff to keep some interest throughout.

    I think the title came from a logic sentence in a book I was reading around that time.

  <p style="font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left;">
    I made this because I was reading a book about my workplace and when going into the history of the place and music in general in the 20th century
    there was a lot of discussion of 'serial music' which I had no real clear definition of. So, I researched that a bit and came across this Schoenberg guy
    and his 12-tone system. Using all the keys in an octave and not giving dominance to any tonic, dominant etc. All of equal importance.
    <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQHR_Z8XVvI>Its quite atonal</a> music, I decided to put the theory into practice because <a href="https://youtu.be/wa_vhGPRuhs?list=PLXhbW5Xg1oPdIFpYVhd0M7Uj9bmqVwXUF">I found</a> that there is a very rigourous way of defining the note orderings you will use and
    then sticking to that

  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.3em; text-align: left;">
    I used the note ordering: C D# E A# F F# C# D G# A B G (which is actually just what the guy in the video used) and used some follow actions to move
    through different clips playing that sequence but transposed differently and of different lengths.
    I had another sequence running on a drum synth where it was using that same sequence but also moving between reversed and inverted versions using
    more random follow actions.

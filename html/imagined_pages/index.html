    <h1>Imagined Pages</h1>
    <p>
        This is a page to explore, imagine, dream of some of the pages I've thought about adding to this
        wonderful website but have so far either been too lazy or incompetent to create.
    </p>
    <p> I invite you to settle down with a tea or coffee, read the descriptions of the pages below 
        (multiple times if necessary), then close your eyes and try to visualise the experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Sound Library</h2>

    <p>
    I've become somewhat of a digital horder over the years I think... it started off with 
    wanting to find little snippets of sound on the internet to sprinkle through songs</br>
    This quickly gave way to an obsession with accumulating an external hard drives worth of 
    digital detritus. 
    <p>
    The actual hard drive itself is like a bomb site, just no organisation whatsoever. But I'd 
    like to play the role of an archivist and expose some of this junk to the wider world. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Like as a jukebox of sound? Or what about some kind of map which groups sounds by similarity?
    </p>

    <h2>Invasion of privacy</h2>

    <p>
    A lofi webcam (possibly a raspberry pi cam?) which broadcasts a live stream from my desk. This could 
    either be a continuous feed or start at random times in the day for random periods of time.
    </p>

    <p>
    This would expose my daily home life to the wider world and possibly get me caught in incriminating 
    situations! What a thrill
    </p>

    <h2>Eccojam generator</h2>
    <p>
        I love the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Person%27s_Eccojams_Vol._1">Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1
        </a> album and have dabbled in making that heavily chopped & screwed music myself over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is quite a specific process to creating one of these ecco's, almost algorithmic in a sense.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Find a song ripe for eccojammin</li>
        <li>Extract a small loop which expresses some kind of melancholic or wistful longing</li>
        <li>Pitch shift it down to rinse this feeling for all its worth</li>
        <li>Drown it in delay and reverb</li>
        <li>Repeat the loop until everyone loses the will to live</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    So, quite a simple recipe. The hardest part is finding that little snatch of audio which really 
    stabs you in the heart. Not a good job for a computer... but what if we could ask it to do the rest 
    for us?
    </p>
    
    <h2>Endless dancing</h2>
    <p>
        I have accumulated quite a large private collection of dancing gifs. Mostly ones I've stolen
        gradually from the NTS radio discord.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would like to put these on a single page all playing at once.
        Which would probably have the effect of crashing the unsuspecting visitors browser. But at least we go down dancing.

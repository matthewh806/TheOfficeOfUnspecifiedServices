  <h1>Software</h1>
  <p>
    Below you'll find some links to some software ideas / projects I've worked on that I feel are interesting or developed enough to share.
  </p>
  <p>
    They're mostly just prototypes or demos of ideas I've had and so very far from production ready. Therefore you'll encounter bugs / issues / horrific UI everywhere
  </p>
  <p>
    As I've worked most recently in the audio programming domain and find myself increasingly interested in sound, most of the projects are in that domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of the code projects listed below can be found in <a href="https://github.com/matthewh806/killing_me_softly_with_his_dsp">this monolithic repository</a> I made. 
    Plus a bunch of other applications and ideas.

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>I always enjoyed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHoDUCAd4-I">Tombola Sequencer</a> on the Teenage Engineering OP-1</p>

    <p>
      I thought it would be nice to have a version which didn't require you to break the bank and buy an OP-1. I did a bit of research beforehand
      and didn't find many examples of people implementing it for mac / windows / linux 
      (Though, saying that, there is <a href="https://github.com/teesloane/laundromat">Laundromat</a> which looks quite nice, but admittedly I didn't
      try it out because I wanted to go through the coding exercise myself.)
    </p>

    <p>
      So, anyway, what is it? Well, its a random sequencer based on polygon worlds and balls bouncing around inside that world colliding and 
      sending out midi notes - if you have a synth or a DAW listening on the right midi channel, you might just hear some sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each ball in the world is associated with a specific MIDI note and when it collides with the edges of the world or any other balls that note will play.
      The range of notes can be played in via a MIDI or randomly assigned (see below)
    </p>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>
      A very early version can be downloaded <a href="assets/Pulsar-v0.0.1-macOS.zip">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note 1: this has only been tested on macOS at this stage - so may not work on Windows / Linux (but maybe it will!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Note 2: I don't have a personal Apple developer account and so, unfortunately, the zip is not signed / notarised. 
      This means 
      <ol>
          <li>You'll have to trust me not to do anything nefarious</li>
          <li>Go into System Preferences -> Security Privacy and allow the software to be run</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the dependencies are bundled into the application - so there's no need to install any extra software
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>
      It is simply a standalone application at the moment (though really... it should be a VST...), so after unzipping & double clicking the icon 
      you should be presented with the following:
    </p>

    <h3>Midi</h3>

    Firstly note that this application does not do any sound generation of its own - its simply a MIDI sequencer which takes in and passes on midi 
    information from / to other devices. 

    <p>
      At the top are dropdown boxes to control the Midi In / Out ports and channels
      <ul>
        <li>Midi In: This allows you to play in desired notes. When a MIDI note is triggered from an external device a new ball will be born in the world
          and be associated with the Note played in. 
        </li>
        <li>Midi Out: This is the device to which the MIDI information is sent when a collision occurs. Note: This device will be responsible for generating the sound</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are working entirely within the box, with virtual / software instruments you probably need some specific routing software. 
      For macOS I recommend looking into the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/audio-midi-setup/ams1013/mac">IAC Driver</a> to handle this.
    </p>

    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>
      Once the MIDI is set up as desired with a synth / DAW, the first thing to do is to check you get some sound out so just click randomly
      a couple of times inside the polygon and you should hear something each time a collision occurs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the "h" key will bring up a small help menu describing further controls to manipulate the universe - such as rotation, edge separation etc
    </p>
    <p>
      Keys 3-9 will generate a new world with a polygon with sides corresponding to the number you pressed (note: 9 crashes the application currently...)
    </p>
    <p>
      When clicking inside the polygon notes are randomly generated across the whole MIDI note range, if you wish to constrain the values to a particular
      scale and / or key, use the drop down menus at the bottom. This will lead to more harmonious results. 
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are a few quick video demonstrations of how to use it using soft synths: </p>

    <p>
      The first example shows its usage with a standalone soft synth (Arturia's Pigments in this case). Note the MIDI routing settings
      in both Pulsar and Pigments

    <p>
      This example shows how to set up a MIDI channel with a VST loaded in Ableton, again, notice the MIDI routing settings
